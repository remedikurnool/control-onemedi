# OneMedi API Server

This directory contains the Express.js API server code for OneMedi Healthcare Platform.

## Note
This API server is separate from the frontend application and is not included in the frontend build process. It's kept here for reference and future backend development.

## Files
- `index.ts` - Main API server entry point
- `middleware/` - Authentication and security middleware
- `routes/` - API route handlers
- `config/` - API configuration
- `utils/` - Utility functions

## Setup (for future use)
1. Install Node.js dependencies
2. Set up environment variables
3. Configure database connection
4. Run the server

This is currently not active as the frontend uses mock data for development.
